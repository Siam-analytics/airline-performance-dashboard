# ✈️ Airline Performance & Fleet Utilization Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global airline performance using operational and financial metrics such as fleet size, EBIT (USD), ASK, passenger yield, and load factor. The visualizations explore the contrast between low-cost carriers and traditional airlines across regions.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Total Fleet Size**: Track how airline fleets are distributed globally.
- **ASK (Available Seat Kilometers)**: Identify which regions lead the seat-kilometer battle.
- **Load Factor vs. EBIT Analysis**: Understand why higher occupancy doesn't always mean higher profit.
- **Low-Cost vs. Traditional Airlines**:
  - Compare EBIT, passenger yield, and load factor.
  - Visual insights into efficiency and revenue generation.
- **Region-wise Breakdown**: See regional differences in fleet capacity, ASK, and EBIT.

## 📊 Key Visuals

- **Scatter Plot:** “Why Flying Full Doesn’t Always Mean Flying Rich” – compares load factor with EBIT, bubble-sized by fleet size, colored by carrier type.
- **Bar Charts:** Region-wise total ASK, fleet size, and EBIT breakdown.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Low-cost carriers vs. traditional airlines on efficiency and profitability.
- **Interactive Filters:** Region, airline name, and carrier type slicers for dynamic analysis.

## 📥 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Use slicers to filter by airline, region, and carrier type.
3. Hover over the scatter plot or bar charts for rich tooltips and insights.
4. Explore how operational scale relates to profitability across different airline segments.

## 🧠 Insight Summary

> Budget airlines may fly fuller but don't always earn more. Larger fleets and ASK volumes don’t guarantee high EBIT, showing the importance of strategic efficiency over sheer scale.
